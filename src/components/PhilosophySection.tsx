          <p>I believe good design aligns structure with perception. It should not only work, but feel right. A clear flow, supported by intentional visuals and language, helps users act without hesitation. To me, aesthetics are part of how we communicate</p>

        <div className="flex-1 w-[520px] philosophy-text">
          <p>clarity not just decoration. That's why I value purposeful layout, readable hierarchy, and design systems that scale. Design isn't about finishing fast. It's about reducing friction through decisions that make sense and visuals that speak clearly.</p>

        <div className="flex-1 w-[520px] philosophy-text">
          <p>I don't separate function and form â€” I design them together, so users don't have to think twice. Every detail, from spacing to wording, exists to support a single goal: clarity. Good design earns trust by being clear, calm, and out of the way.</p>
